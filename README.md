In a perfect world, that which is most loved would correspond to that which is least hated. 
This is, however, hardly the case.
Here is a very simple implementation (I have no experience whatsoever with either html, javascript, blockchain) of an idea:
from a number of events registered by users of the app (where an event consists of a sentence which might represent a thought, saying, historical event, artistic expression, joke, and anything in between), one is selected to become part of a bright history (the most upvoted), and one is selected to become part of a dark history (the least downvoted). An event might be selected for both.

It had ocurred to me that when there is monetary compensation involved for positive content, there is a tendency for a sort of sickening positiveness, which becomes (perhaps only for me) quite annoying and shallow-feeling. 
In this scenario, negative content is also rewarded (in a way) by downvotes, and hence there is a price to pay (paid to the negative poster) to make that content fade away. This creates a negative feedback loop, where that which appears in the spotlight is bound to receive compensation and momentary fame, but is also subject to more hate and thus tends to fade from the dark history, where only the less popular least hated posters will be immortalized.
